some solutions for easy problems
some problems are from codeforces and Toj.
I am a new to the acm competition, so I prefer to do some easy problems to improve my confidence.
I want to improve my coding skill and manage my codes to adapt our lab often change someone's computer.
So that i don't need to copy my codes when i go to another places.
I will update my essaies and code unscheduled.
At last, welcome to my git to help each other.
